        <div class="subtitle">Who am I?</div>
          <p>Millennial IT guy working for a soul-less corporation. I don't believe that we should define ourselves by our occupations, as we are so much more than that. I live in a modest home in one of the many suburbs of the DFW metroplex with my wife, 2 dogs, and 3 cats. I like to spend my down time gaming, reading, and listening to music.</p>
          <p>I also enjoy cooking! I spent a lot of time during the pandemic improving my cooking skills. I dabbled in cuisines from various cultures, especially Japanese and Korean. My most proud accomplishment was learning fermentation and making a huge batch of kimchi. I've also made my own fermented mustard and hot sauce. I also rekindled my love for metal music during quarantine and taught myself how to scream. Now, I'm hobby hopping again and learning web development, because why not? </p>

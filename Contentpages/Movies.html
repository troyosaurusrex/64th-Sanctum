          <p>I recently found this amazing app to track the movies you've watched. It's like GoodReads but for movies. I'm still working towards creating a gallery of my Letterboxd reviews on the site but that's probably months down the line. This page is going to remain barren until then because I don't feel like duplicating all the Letterboxd content by hand.</p>
          <p>If you like horror movies (especially zombies), action and kung-fu, comedy, fantasy, and weird stuff, then check it out. You'll probably find some good movies to watch.</p>

          <div class="subtitle">Recently Watched TV Shows</div>
          <p>Pictures Coming soon!</p>
          <p>The Bear - Fantastic, 10/10. Loved Jeremy Allen White in Shameless and he absolutely killed it here. This show really nails the chaotic and stressful feeling of working in a kitchen...not that I've ever done that personally lol. I could only watch 2 episodes at a time due to the intensity. It was honestly kinda stressful to watch, but masterfully acted.</p>
          <p>Reservation Dogs - This show has a lot of heart. It's good to see some media from underrepresented folks. I've seen a few horror movies with primarily Native actors and really enjoyed them. Reservation Dogs is funny but it also deals with the hardships of living on a reservation. It can be very sad at times but it also has great relationships between the characters.</p>
          <p>Severance - I kinda wish I didn't find out about it until it was finished, because I'm eagerly awaiting season 2. Don't read anything about it, just go watch it. The concept is, what if we could separate our work selves from our regular selves via 'severing' the memories between the 2? If that doesn't instantly grab you then you aren't into interesting things. </p>
          <p>Peacemaker - Didn't know how long this list was gonna be until I started writing it, but damn there's been a lot of good shows this year! Peacemaker is just pure fun to watch with the best opener I've ever seen on a show.</p>
          <p>What We Do in the Shadows - I slept on this show for way too long but it's going to enter my list of all-time comfort shows for sure. It's like The Office, but instead of office workers it's vampires.</p>

          <p>I've always been a hobby hopper, but the various categories in the left sidebar ought to contain most of my interests. I may use this 'Now' page to track my current projects and posts I'm working on. My ADHD is best managed with lists and trackers. I decided I didn't like my to-do list on the index page so now it lives here!</p>
          <p>I'm mostly focused on my internal life right now - building a happy home with my wife and pets, and cultivating all of my hobbies. This website is an attempt to document my life, or at least the aspects I care enough to share. Which, to be fair, is most things. I'm not shy.</p>

                <p>Figure out what to put in place of the to-do list on my index page, if anything. Maybe it becomes a place for linkbacks and 88x31 images, but if so then what do I put on the right sidebar?</p>

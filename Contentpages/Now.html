          <p>I've always been a hobby hopper, but the various categories in the left sidebar ought to contain most of my interests. I may use this 'Now' page to track my current projects and posts I'm working on. My ADHD is best managed with lists and trackers. I decided I didn't like my to-do list on the index page so now it lives here! This is to help me track my ideas even if they take months to work on.</p>
          <p>I'm mostly focused on my internal life right now - building a happy home with my wife and pets, and cultivating all of my hobbies. This website is an attempt to document my life, or at least the aspects I care enough to share. Which, to be fair, is most things. I'm not shy.</p>

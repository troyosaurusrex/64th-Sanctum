          <p>Thoughts about life, and philosophy. I've been into reading about stoicism and zen lately, so don't be surprised to eventually see an article about them. I have a stack of books to get through first, so it may be a bit before those show up.</p> 
          <p>I've been reading about the S-ART framework of mindfulness and would like to make a post on it. Mindfulness is one of the most valuable skills one can possess in this crazy ass world we live in and I would very much like to share it with you.</p>

        <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1290343.Bankei_Zen">Bankei Zen: Translations from the Record of Bankei </a>-- Bit of a broken record, I think I read the phrase "marvellously illuminating unborn buddha mind" at least 50 times, but it was a good read! Nothing wrong with keeping it simple, stupid! I wouldn't recommend this as your first Zen book, but once you know a few concepts it's worth a read. Bankei says that we all possess the zen spirit, the unborn buddha mind as he calls it, and that most people try to overcomplicate it. This book helped me further understand the concept of attachment vs non-attachment. I definitely plan to revisit this one in the future and to take notes.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/514210.The_Way_of_Zen">The Way of Zen, by Alan Watts </a>-- This was my intro to Zen philosophy. It provided historical background as well as a look at some specific practices and practitioners. It's an attempt of the West to understand the East, essentially, and for that reason I highly recommend this if you're just getting started learning about Zen philosophy.</p>
        <p><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/30659.Meditations">Meditations, by Marcus Aurelius </a>-- Meditations was my foray into Stoicism. Really enjoyed this one a lot and it's another I intend to come back to and take notes on. Stoicism is about internal strength, and realizing that things aren't really good or bad, instead it is our opinions on things which make us feel a certain way. I find stoicism really valuable with the world we live in. The internet exposes us to all of the injustices and atrocities of the world, and it can feel draining. But, turns out, you don't have to have an opinion on everything! You can be the rock in the stream, and let things just pass you by none worse for wear. There's a lot more to it than that, but that's what I find valuable - I may not have a choice on what happens, but I can control how I react to things. Stoicism for me is about resilience and doing right even in the face of adversity. If you're curious about stocisim, Meditations is a great jump-off point. </p>

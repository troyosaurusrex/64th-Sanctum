          <p class="centertext">First of all, Bloodywood is the perfect name for an Indian metal band. They have a really unique sound blending modern metal with a traditional/cultural Indian flavor resulting in something really special, unlike anything I've ever heard. They quickly became one of my all-time favorite metal bands and I hope you enjoy them, too! I first discovered these guys thanks to my good friend Mark sharing the song Machi Bhasad.</p>

            <figcaption>Machi Bhasad is a track with a political message that celebrates the power of a new generation and its potential to be better than the last. This song is intended as both a tribute and a call to action. It's a tribute to musicians and leaders who inspired people like ourselves to think and act in a way that'll benefit everyone. To question an unjust system that serves a few at the cost of the many.  It's a call to action for our generation to finish the work started by all those who came before us. To Become the straw that broke the proverbial camel's back, and change the world for the better.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="centertext">Badass right? Well that's not all. They've also got a song about respecting women and beating up rapists. Fucking awesome:</p>

              <figcaption>Dana Dan is a graphic commentary on sexual assault and the need to eliminate it. It begins with the reflexive, almost homicidal rage we feel when we hear about these crimes, before moving on to a more level headed call to arms. It culminates in a gentle appeal for all of us to reflect on the role we play in creating a world where atrocities of this nature are committed and to work towards eliminating it altogether.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="centertext">Then we have Aaj, a song about inner strength and always moving forward, always being better. Also, sick DBZ reference in this song! The flute and female vocals really elevate Aaj to the next level.</p>
          <figure>
              <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgvH6tX4Ej0" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              <figcaption>Aaj is a song about the moment in time when you realise you have the strength to do what you have to do to become who you want to become. We all have our demons, our reasons to be stuck in a rut of harmful patterns and our fears of trying something new. This track is meant to act as a spark to light a fire within the listener to overcome all of that, it's about the fearless pursuit of the next level for as long as your heart continues to beat. It marks the first occasion where the band has combined the Indian flute with electronic elements as well as the usual dose of heavy riffs, diabolical growls and powerful rap verses.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="centertext">Next up we have Gaddaar. This one sounds a little bit similar to Machi Bhasad, but it's still solid due to the lyrics talking about the importance of the separation of church and state.</p>
          <figure>
              <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7iKjSCTxke8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
              <figcaption>Gaddaar is a song that's aimed at a complete separation of religion and politics across the world. Everyone deserves equal rights and equal treatment at the hands of their governments no matter who and how they worship. We've seen the use of religious and divisive politics globally in recent years and it needs to be spoken about.</figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p class="centertext">Endurant is just awesome. I love the lyrics, they really hit on the ethos of Stoicism with the chorus on this one:<br> "I am not voiceless, I am endurant.<br> I am not a stray rock, I am the founding stone of a mountain<br> I am not weak, I am forgiving<br>
              Within darkeness, I am my own light"</p>

          <p class="centertext">The last song I'll share from their new album 'Rakshak' is called Jee Veerey. This song is about overcoming mental illness. When they released this video, they even pre-bought 60 counseling sessions for folks to take advantage of, which is just awesome.</p>
          <figure>

              <figcaption>Amongst the calm grasslands, forests and fresh water streams of beloved Himachal Pradesh - here's an original folk metal track "Jee Veerey" (literal translation: Live, Brave One). A song that speaks about enduring and braving through a highly overlooked but rampant problem - mental illness. </figcaption>

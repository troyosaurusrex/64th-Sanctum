          <p>The first Fire Emblem Warriors felt more like a warriors game with a Fire Emblem skin. You could command your allies around the map, but that was about the extent of the strategy. Three Hopes, meanwhile, feels much more like a Fire Emblem game with musou style combat. There's a much bigger focus on strategy and what occurs outside of combat compared to FE:W. Whether this is a good or bad thing probably depends on you, but I've been enjoying it. </p>
          <p>Now, I'm going to rank the characters from each house. Some characters can join on multiple routes, and the Ashen Wolves I believe can join everybody. I will rank the characters according to the house they "belong" to and will add them as I play through the different routes, so check back later for more updates.</p>

          <div class="subtitle">Character Rankings</div>
          <h2 style="color: gold">Golden Deer</h2>
          <p>Claude: Mr. Strategy, the man with the plan. Bows are just ok in this game, but Joe Zieja gives a great performance as Claude, as he did in Three Houses. Also, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhWhTbe3MWk">he's got serious pipes</a> and for that, Claude gets a 9.9/10.<a href="https://youtu.be/lZGeEPflV2o">Here's the man himself telling you why you should buy this game.</a></p>
          <p>Holst: Absolute legend. Badass booming voice, amazing spiky pink hair, huge muscles. And that imposing figure! Holst is a perfect 10/10. Sorry Claude, there's a new favorite in town. (I didn't even know Holst was voiced by Sungwon Cho, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/ProZD">who runs one of my favorite Youtube channels</a> until after I wrote this lol)</p>
          <p>Hilda: The axe moveset feels a bit sluggish, but she puts out big damage. And she's related to best boy Holst, so that's a solid 8.3/10.</p>
          <p>Ignatz: He's a benchwarmer, 5/10</p>
          <p>Raphael: Cares for his family, I could feasibly see him saying "I fight for my friends", real good at punching, solid 7.2/10</p>
          <p>Lysithea: She's as much a beast as she was in Three Houses, 8.5/10</p>
          <p>Marianne: Kinda boring as a character but she freezes nearby enemies at 300+ hit count which is effective. 8/10</p>
          <p>Lorenz: Noble asshole, but he's still better than Leonie if you need a spear user. I usually have him as one of the nonplayable units on the map. 6.2/10</p>
          <p>Leonie: Even in a game where Jeralt is your enemy, he's still the entire facet of Leonie's personality. 2/10, get a real personality!</p>
          <h2 style="color: blue">Blue Lions</h2>
          <h2 style="color: red">Black Eagles</h2>
          <p>Bernadetta: Weaponized social anxiety, I like that you still have to talk to her behind a door in Three Hopes. 6/10</p>
          <p>Petra: I want to like Petra because she was a monster in my 3 Houses game, but she has a weak unique ability (dodge focused), cool outfit though. 6.5/10 for now, might change when I actually do black eagle route.</p>
          <h2 style="color: mediumpurple">Ashen Wolves</h2>
          <p>Balthus: S tier for farming, his unique ability gives gold whenever you send enemies flying at 300+ hit count. He's a lovable scamp with a gambling addiction, 8.8/10</p>
          <p>Constance: Good unique support ability as a mage adjutant. I don't have strong feelings on Constance in either direction, 6/10</p>
          <p>Hapi: Classic dark mage, good adjutant if fighting monsters, 6/10 for now</p>
          <p>Yuri: Weak unique ability, but he looks fly as hell. Best new outfit of the whole game. 9.5/10 on appearances alone</p>
          <h2 style="color: palegreen">Church/Other</h2>
          <p>Shez: New main character, I'm a fan. As is the case in most Fire Emblem games, the main character is OP as hell, so 9.8/10</p>
          <p>Shamir: The strong, silent type. Bit of an edgelord but dependable in a fight. 7.7/10</p>
          <p>Byleth: Been there done that, 7.9/10 too much Sothis</p>
          <p>Jeralt: Immediately fawned over by Leonie, 5/10 by association only because he has good skills.</p>

        <div class="subtitle">How is Fire Emblem Warriors: Three Hopes compared to other Musou games?</div>
          <p>
            Honestly, pretty good! This is a spin-off title so I won't compare it to the mainline Warriors games, but it's very good. Fire Emblem Warriors and Hyrule Warriors (the first one) are probably my other favorite spin-off titles. I really wanted to like Persona 5 Strikers since I love Persona 5, but I struggled to stay engaged with it for some reason. I might try to go back to it at some point.
          </p>
          <p>
            The performance is decent. It's an unlocked frame rate but it's pretty close to 30 fps most of the time. It's certainly better in the performance department than Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity. That game literally hurts my eyes. It would have been my other favorite spin-off if not for the performance. Perhaps if a "Switch Pro" ever comes out, it'll be good.
          </p>
          <p>
            As I mentioned at the start of this article, Three Hopes does a really good job of feeling like a true successor to Fire Emblem: Three Houses. It helps that Koei did a lot of work on Three Houses so they were able to re-use a lot of the assets. In my opinion, this is the closest a spin-off musou game has gotten to nailing the feeling of the source material.

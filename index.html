      <div>This is going to be a place I mess around with HTML, CSS, potentially JS once I get a good handle on HTML and CSS. It's probably going to look shitty on mobile, sorry. The page is optimized to look good on my personal monitor. I'm also going to be writing about stuff I like. I may do a re-read of The Cosmere or all of The First Law books and do a retrospective on each one. I may also write about other books I'm reading. I might recap DnD or talk about Warhammer. I'll definitely write about RPGs and games in the musou genre. I may document travels with my wife, write about the philosophy I'm reading, talk about (mostly metal) music, and who knows what else. We're making this shit up as we go. This website is under heavy construction so sorry in advance for any dead links. I struggle picking a layout. If you have any advice let me know!</div> </article>

        <p>In the bottom left is where I would put my widget. <img src="/Images/ifihad1.PNG" alt="If I had one!" style="width:200px;height:200px;"> </p>
